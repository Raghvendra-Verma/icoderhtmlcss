        <p style="color:red">
            Our company founder Sh.Ramesh “Nico” Khanna being a deeply
            spiritual person sought an audience with His HolinessThe
            Dalai Lama to seek his blessings in his endeavour to promote
            sea buckthorn. Here he is seen receiving blessings from His
            Holiness, The Dalai Lama, whose summer residence is only a few
            kilometers from the main harvest site. When His Holiness The
            Dalai Lama , heard of this unique opportunity given to women ,
            self help groups and farmers of the region by company founder,
            Ramesh “Nico” Khanna, he called it a “blessed effort”.
            Nico first conceptualized and founded his herbal company and
            manufacturing facility in 1993 and channelised his immense
            knowledge of herbs and ayurveda into development of wellness,
            health and cosmetic products marketed worldwide.

        <img src="image/seabuck4.PNG" alt="default image">
        <p style="color:red">
            I was born in a small village in the foothills of the Himalayas.
            My father was a professor and my mother was a teacher. When I
            was young my mother became very sick. I carefully watched as
            ayurvedic doctors and herbalists worked with my mother to make her
            well. Thus I experienced first hand the amazing effect Ayurveda had
            on her recovery.
            Ayurveda is a form of healing that was introduced in modern India
            thousands of years ago. The term Ayurveda means “knowledge of life”
            and is also known as the “science of life”. This method of healing
            focuses on establishing and maintaining a full balance of health by
            treating the whole person rather than focusing on individual symptoms.
            The ayurveda principle is based on principles of wholeness and balance.
            According to Charak, the ancient ayurvedic scholar, life is comprised
            of five essential parts – a combination of mind, body, senses, emotions
            and the soul. Balance is the most important philosophy of ayurveda.
            Those who practice ayurveda believe that perfect health is a state where
            body, mind and spirit are balanced. When these systems are balanced the
            body can function at optimal levels and experience perfect health.

            The experience of watching Ayurvedic doctors heal my mother led me to graduate in
            science. I then proceeded to study herbs to learn the practical knowledge of health.
            I have since travelled the Himalayas and studied herbs for the past 35 years, and more
            specifically tribal folklore medicine for the past 25 years.

            When I was about 20 years old I spent some time in a Himalayan village located
            at an altitude of about 9500 feet. One day I asked a young woman what the village
            customs were when someone died. Her reply intrigued me. She indicated that no one
            dies in that village. I asked her what she meant by that, and her reply was the same – simply
            that no one dies. I asked the young woman to take me to her mother – to her I directed the
            same question. The mother replied that a few years ago her great uncle had died after falling
            off a cliff, but that was a rarity. As I questioned her further it became clear that people in
            that village did not become sick and die. I wondered out loud how this could be possible and the
            mother told me about the seabuckthorn fruit. This small fruit, she said, grew abundantly in the
            rugged mountains surrounding their village, and was consumed by the people both as a fruit and in
            their water. Remarkably in 30 years no one in the village had died of illness or disease. This is
            sea buckthorn – the secret of the Himalayas.
