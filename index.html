                <p style="color:rgb(29, 211, 29)">
                    Heaven’s Fruit, the wonder berry from the
                    Himalayas- wild seabuckthorn is known as
                    nature’s most balanced fruit. Sea buckthorn
                    thrives in the harsh conditions and high
                    altitudes of the Himalayas.

                <h2>Key Nutrients of Sea buckthorn</h2>
                <p style="color:rgb(29, 211, 29)">
                    Seabuckthorn contains more than 190 biologically
                    active compounds. Included in these 190 nutrients,
                    many of which being water soluble cannot be stored
                    by the human body and are essentially required.

                <h2>Health Benefits of Sea buckthorn</h2>
                <p style="color:rgb(29, 211, 29)">
                    The ancient Tibetians in their medical book,
                    Sibu Yidian - written about 1300 years ago - documented
                    the nutritional uses of seabuckthorn for health and beauty.
                    Sibu Yidian says that seabuckthorn âtonifies yin and
                    strengthens yang which means seabuckthorn creates balance.

                I had very high cholesterol levels and was recommended
                very strong medication to get the levels in control. I
                decided to go natural and tried Biosash Seabuckthorn
                Seed oil capsules, Seabuckthorn Juice and Seabuckthorn
                Berry Oil capsules. I was surprised with the results
                after two months – my levels were significantly lower
                without side effects. I am grateful to Biosash for
                making available such amazing, natural , and world class
                products in India.<br><br>

                I was plagued with severe low energy issues and dark
                circles under my eyes and didn’t know what to do.
                After I used Seabuckthorn Bioradiance Juice and
                Seabuckthorn seed oil capsules for 10 days I saw that
                my dark circles were almost gone and I didn’t feel so
                low on energy. Not just this, my hair fall problem has
                also more or less stopped. The best part that its all
                natural , non toxic and has no side effects.<br><br>

                I have tried many skin care cosmetics but was never fully
                satisfied. This Seabuckthorn line of skincare by Biosash
                intrigued me and I tried it out. Biosash skin care cosmetics
                and creams are unlike any that I have used before. They
                have improved my skin quality and skin tone and texture
                and I am totally hooked to the brand.<br><br>
